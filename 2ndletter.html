        My Love,
        <br>
        I would like you to know that from the moment I met you, I knew there was something different about you something familiar, something that felt like home. Itâ€™s as if the universe had been waiting for our paths to cross, knowing we were always meant to find each other. Every conversation, every moment spent with you, has only confirmed that you are my other half the missing piece I never knew I was searching for.

            I have never felt this kind of connection with anyone before. The way we think alike, the way we understand each other without even speaking itâ€™s as if our souls have been communicating all along. Our shared dreams, passions, and even the little things we both love make me believe that fate has been silently guiding us toward each other all this time.

            With you, I am complete. Itâ€™s not just about love itâ€™s about feeling truly seen, truly understood, truly whole. You know the real me, and yet, you love me even more for it. With you, I donâ€™t have to explain myself you just get me, and for that, my love, it is the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced.

            I love how we can talk for hours without ever running out of things to say, yet be just as comfortable in silence. I love how you finish my sentences, how you laugh at the same things I do, and how we share the same thoughts at the exact same moment. I love how effortlessly we fit together, as if we were always meant to be side by side.

            Before you, I didnâ€™t know what it truly meant to have someone who understands me on every level. But now, I canâ€™t imagine life without you. You have filled the spaces in my heart that I didnâ€™t even realize were empty. You are my greatest love, my safest place, my home.

            No matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, one thing will always remain the same I will always choose you. Because in you, I have found everything Iâ€™ve ever needed.

        <br><br>
        I love you my love, my other half, my forever with all my heart Bianca Alexandrine Briones.ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
